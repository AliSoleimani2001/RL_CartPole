# RL_CartPole
Building, simulating, and controlling an inverted pendulum (cart pole) using RL in Python and PID in Matlab.
I designed and implemented an inverted pendulum (cart-pole) system, applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) in Python for dynamic balance control and PID control in MATLAB for precise stabilization. Through successful simulation and control of the system, I demonstrated my expertise in control theory, algorithm development, and integrating tools across platforms.
